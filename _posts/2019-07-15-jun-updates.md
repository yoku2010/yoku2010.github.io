### This is a recap of open source activities and development at Zalando in the month of June

## Project Highlights 

- [Kopf - Kubernetes Operator Pythonic Framework](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/kopf) now supports built-in resources and can be used to write controllers of any kind (pods, namespaces, mixed), not only of custom resources. Check out the latest release for more details [https://github.com/zalando-incubator/kopf/releases](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/kopf/releases)

- [Skipper](https://github.com/zalando/skipper) publishes new releases weekly. Some of the important features were implemented such as support to proxy Kubernetes API server and support Kubernetes externalName services from ingress. 

- [Kubernetes Ingress Controller for AWS](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/kube-ingress-aws-controller ) added dualstack and ssl-policy support in its last release. The controller helps to configure AWS application load balancers according to Kubernetes Ingress resources. 

## Foster diversity and inclusion in tech 

Zalando hosted the launch event of Persian Women In Tech Berlin. This is the first event of  the new Berlin chapter of the international organization of [Persian Women in Tech](http://www.persianwomenintech.com/). [Shery Brauner](https://twitter.com/sherybrauner), spoke about her career path from Iran to Germany, daring to take risks and now leading an engineering team at Zalando.
