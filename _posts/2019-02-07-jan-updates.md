### This is a recap of open source activities and development at Zalando in the month of January

## Project Highlights 

[Nakadi](https://nakadi.io) made its way to FOSDEM 2019. This is one of the largest open source projects released by Zalando. Nakadi is a distributed event bus that implements a RESTful API abstraction on top of Kafka-like queues. It is used in production by over a hundred teams daily and handles over 100 TB of data every day. Try out [Nakadi](https://github.com/zalando/nakadi)!

**Two new projects entered Zalando-Incubator this month:**

- [Transformer](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/Transformer) is a tool to transform/convert web browser sessions (HAR files) into Locust load testing scenarios (locustfile). This tool can be used when users have HAR files (containing recordings of interactions with your website) that they then want to replay in load tests using Locust.

- [Autoscaler](https://github.com/zalando-incubator/autoscaler) is a component that automatically adjusts the size of a Kubernetes Cluster so that all pods have a place to run and there are no unneeded nodes. This is a fork of [Kubernetes Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler). Our goal is to test and deploy the project in a large scale environment at Zalando, then propose upstream contributions, so the whole community can benefit from our experiments. 

In addition to the project highlights, we recently released a [policy](https://opensource.zalando.com/docs/resources/harassment-policy) to handle harassment in open source. At Zalando we encourage our employees to take active part in open source development. And we as a company commit to provide our full support to developers who engage in open source on Zalandos behalf.
