      <h4 class="dc-h4 insight__title">We take responsibility for our releases</h4>
      <p class="dc-p">
        Number of released projects are decreasing compared to 2015 and 2016 and is expected to stay at 15 new projects per year, this is a deliberate strategy of mastery over open sourcing everything

      <h4 class="dc-h4 insight__title">A core group of employees are driving contribution</h4>
      <p class="dc-p">
        The number of Zalando employees responsible for 80% of all contribution is low,
        sitting at 50 employees. It is however normal that a small core group
        is responsible for the majority of the work.
        The size and diversity of this group must be increased.

    <div class="insight__container">
      <h4 class="dc-h4 insight__title">Projects are healthy and compliant</h4>
      <p class="dc-p">
        Overall health and compliance of released projects are acceptable,
        there is a low number of open pull requests and the average time
        from contribution to acceptance is low at 85 hours. We do however see a low
        number of projects with a code of conduct. We will actively work on making
        this a requirement.

      <h4 class="dc-h4 insight__title">We share our infrastructure</h4>
      <p class="dc-p">
        Projects released by Zalando are typically developer infrastructure projects
        released by
        <abbr title="Teams responsible for our infrastructure and developer tooling">Digital Foundation</abbr> teams. Open source engagement for
        <abbr title="Teams responsible for building the zalando fashion store">Digital Experience</abbr> teams are relatively
        low and we want to increase their engagement.
