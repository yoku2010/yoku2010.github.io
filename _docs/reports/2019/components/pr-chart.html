  Open source activity by Zalando employees (purple) is at a overall stable level with seasonal variations 
  (summer holidays and the run up to black friday are typical low-activity periods). We are however seeing a positive increase in External 
  contribution (blue) to our projects. The single big spike in the chart above is caused by a GitHub bot doing over 100 automated pull requests.

  Our goal for responding to pull requests is 80 hours, this includes weekends and holidays, we generally succeed at keeping our reponse 
  time at a satisfactory level for pull requests by employees but are seeing spikes more often for external contributions. Average 
  across all pull requests is <strong>91 hours</strong>. Unfortunately, this year we had <strong>45</strong> contributions 
  which did not see a response in over 100 days.
