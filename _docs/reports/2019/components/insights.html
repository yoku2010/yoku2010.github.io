      <p class="dc-p">
        We released 25 new projects in 2018, this is a slight increase compared to 2017. However the average

      <p class="dc-p">
        In November we introduced the use of Code of conduct files on all new projects being released
        and are working on introducing this across all public projects. We believe it is an important
        first step towards a friendlier and more diverse open source community.

      <p class="dc-p">
        We introduced the open source promotion framework that acts as an idea catalogue 
        to help project teams grow visibility and increae contributions from the community. 
        
        One of the most successful cases of this work was the Flair project 
        which gained almost 4000 stars, 241 forks, and became a 
        trending repository on github.
