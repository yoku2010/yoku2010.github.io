#### Despite widespread use, there are still many misconceptions and uncertainties for Zalando employees engaging in Open Source. Questions on legal issues, licensing and what is deemed confidential or internal information is common. 

This website is therefore a guide, primarily for Zalando employees, on how to adopt, modify and release Open Source code. There are a few references to internal Zalando sites or services, but with an effort to limit our use of internal lingo or acronyms.
