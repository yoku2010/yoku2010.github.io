#### There are teams and groups at Zalando whom can help you with guidance and tools when working with open source. No matter if you are a maintainer of an open source project, or a developer adopting Open Source code, these groups are here to help. 

## [Open Source Team](../open-source-team)
The Open Source Team works across departments at Zalando to scale open culture and promote best practices of Open Source development.

## [Open Source Review Group](../open-source-review-group)
Works as a mentorship network for new project maintainers as well as the committee responsible for graduating incubation projects.

## [Open Source Guild](../open-source-guild)
The Open Source Guild is an informal internal group of Zalando employees interested in Open Source. Anyone at Zalando can join the guild.
