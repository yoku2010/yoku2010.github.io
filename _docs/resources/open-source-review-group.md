#### The Open Source Review Group is a virtual team consisting of all current maintainers in the main Zalando Github organizations. It functions as a mentor program for new projects and project maintainers, as well as a review committee guiding and helping incubator projects toward graduation into the main Zalando Github organizations. 

## Purpose
- Provide an effective, responsive support group for techies to get peer feedback on OSS projects before and after publication
- Help developers understand the security, compliance, and reputation risks around their open source projects during the entire project lifecycle.
- Act as a mentorship program for new incubator projects to ensure they grow and mature. Ensure that the group of project maintainers grows in size and in diversity.

## Get in touch
The review group consists of members of multiple engineering teams inside Zalando and can be reached via [oss-review@zalando.de](mailto:oss-review@zalando.de). Please exepect responses within a few days.

## Membership
All active maintainers of projects in the GitHub organizations [Zalando](https://github.com/zalando), [Zalando-Nakadi](https://github.com/zalando-nakadi) and [Zalando-Stups](https://github.com/zalando-stups) are automatically members of the Review Group. The Open Source team acts as the group facilitator but are not part of the day to day mentorship and review program.

## Meetings
The group meets every second week to review projects applying for graduation from the incubator. Project mentorship is an ongoing process which takes place in the GitHub team discussions forum.

## Diversity Commitment
Diversity is a central component of Zalando, as an organization of over 100 different nationalities, we acknowledge that this company would not be where it is today without the rich diversity of the people employed here. 

With that said, we are very much aware that especially the technology roles at Zalando and even more so open source participation in general has a very low degree of diversity. The group is therefore currently not diverse, but is tasked with a clear objective of changing this.   

**The Open Source Group is committed to attract, mentor and advance any individuals open source participation, regardless of their race, sexual orientation, religion, age, gender, disability status or any other dimension of diversity.**
