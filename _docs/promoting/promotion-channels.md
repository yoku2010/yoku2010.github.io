Think about your audience, you can chose to publish anything that is interesting for your target audience.

**[Eventbrite](https://eventbrite.com)** is a U.S.based event management platform. The service allows users to browse, create, and promote local events. The service charges a fee to event organizers in exchange for online ticketing services, unless the event is free. 


**[Eventyay](https://eventyay.com)** is a open source event management platform which is very similar to eventbrite including functions like scheduling, ticketing, promotion, call for papers etc.  Additionally, this service offers users the freedom to setup and run events on their own server. 


**[Meetup](https://meetup.com)** is a website providing membership software, allowing its members to schedule events using a common platform. Organizers need to pay a fee to maintain a group and launch events. Members can browse events for free. 

**[Facebook Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Facebook_features#Groups)** is an easy-to-use and common tool to create and promote an event. However, its outreach is limited as there's always too much information on Facebook. A paid-ads event will have a better reach than a free one.
