## Email Content

#### 1st Paragraph: Summary
Explains what is the project and including a link to project website/github. 

#### 2nd Paragraph: Description
Provide interesting details to convince people that it’s worth to check out the project e.g. information about the team, special features, impacts etc.
* If this is the first announcement of a project, you might want to include some instructions of how the project works. 
* If the announcement is for a new version of an existing project that was previously announced on the list, you might want to include a summarized changelog, essentially “What’s new in version x.y:”


#### 3rd Paragraph: Call for action
